# Ruby Study Repository

This is my personal study repository dedicated to exploring the Ruby programming language and the Ruby on Rails framework. Here, I will document my learning and experimentation with these technologies, storing code, notes and related projects. This flexible space reflects my progress in learning more about Ruby and Ruby on Rails.

## [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)

Ruby is a dynamic, open-source, object-oriented programming language known for its elegant syntax and ease of use.

## [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)

Ruby on Rails, often just called Rails, is a web development framework that uses Ruby as its main language. It promotes an agile approach to web application development.

## [Ruby Sinatra](https://sinatrarb.com/)

Ruby Sinatra is a lightweight web framework that stands out for its simplicity and minimalist approach. Unlike Ruby on Rails, which offers a more comprehensive framework, Sinatra is an ideal choice for smaller projects and simple web applications.
